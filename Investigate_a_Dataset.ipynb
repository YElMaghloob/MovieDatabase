    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "For over a hundred years, movies have captured the imaginations and hearts of audiences worldwide. Be it in a cinema or at home, through a giant projection or on a laptop screen, somewhere, someone is wwatching a movie. The making of a successful movie is a complex undertaking, involving many different factors. To try to understand what makes a blockbuster as opposed to a flop, we look at [the movie database (TMDB) dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/tmdb/tmdb-movie-metadata), which holds information on over 10,000 films.\n",
    "\n",
    "Specifically, we look at how movies have changed over the years, in terms of budgets and revenues. We also look at movie release schedules and what patterns emerge from the different seasons.\n",
    "\n",
    "Movie release dates are carefully planned by studios, with the summer and Christmas months considered to be the most profitable [seasons](https://www.quora.com/What-are-considered-the-peak-seasons-for-movie-releases-in-theaters), unlike the so-called \"dump\" months of the rest of the year. So does profit really correlate with the release date? Are horror films more sucessful at Halloween, for example?\n",
    "\n",
    "The questions tackled in this study are as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. How do movie budgets and revenues change across movie genres?\n",
    "    \n",
    "2. How do movies differ across the seasons of the yearly release schedule?\n",
    "    \n",
    "3. How have film revenues and budgets changed across the years?\n",
    "    \n",
    "4. Which release seasons feature the greatest and least numbers of unsuccessful films?"

    "## Conclusions\n",
    "\n",
    "In this study, we analysed some aspects of the TMDB DataSet to try to answer the questions listed below. One major limitation of this dataset is the incorrect entry of arounf half the budget and/or revenue values as 0, resulting in their exclusion of the analysis. A comparison of the results obtained here with those of a bigger dataset following the correction of the entries would be worthwhile.\n",
    "\n",
    "_1. How do movie budgets and revenues change across movie genres?_\n",
    "\n",
    "Using a grouped bar chart, we gave an overview of the mean revenues and budgets of each movie genre. One limitation here is that the analysis was restricted to the first genre listed in the genres column. Classifying a film into a single genre can be difficult, and a more general view may be obtained from taking all the listed genres into account.\n",
    "    \n",
    "_2. How do movies differ across the seasons of the yearly release schedule?_\n",
    "\n",
    "The success of movies is not uniform throughout the year, with the highest revenues obtained during the summer and Christmas seasons. Furthermore, despite the fewer number of horror films released during Halloween, this season sees the majority of horror revenues compared to the rest of the year.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "_3. How have film revenues and budgets changed across the years?_\n",
    "\n",
    "There is a high degree of variability in the data, due to missing and inaccurate values entered for budgets and revenues. However, with the use of scatter plots, we can see that there is an upward trend in both budgets and revenues (adjusted for inflation), with higher increases in revenues.\n",
    "    \n",
    "_4. Which release seasons feature the greatest and least numbers of unsuccessful films?_\n",
    "\n",
    "Defining unsucessful films as those whose revenue-to-budget ratios is less than 1, we can see that these releases correlate more with the dump seasons. However, it is unclear if revenues are restricted to cinema earnings. If so, this would miss films which become more successful over time in the case of home cinema/DVD/streaming. As the DataSet is updated to include more recent films, this will be become more of a necessity.\n",
